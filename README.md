The analysis of future climate change over South Africa as described in the TNC, are the projections of the Coupled Global Climate Models (CGCMs) of of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and AR5 of the IPCC. These projections are used to inform on the uncertainty range of the large-scale climate change futures over the southern African region. At the CSIR, a dynamic regional climate model CCAM (conformal-cubic atmospheric model) of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was used to downscale CMIP5 CGCM projections to 50 km resolution over Africa. These downscalings were for both Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) of AR5 of the IPCC. RCP 4.5 describes a future with relatively ambitious emission reductions whereas RCP 8.5 describes a future with no reductions in emissions. Emissions in RCP 4.5 peak around 2040, then decline and in RCP 8.5 emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The change in temperature is expressed as an anomaly, the difference between the average climate over a period of the last several decades (1971-2000), and the projected climate (short to medium term 2021 to 2050). The simulations were performed on supercomputers of the CSIRO and on the Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) of the Meraka Institute of the CSIR in South Africa.
